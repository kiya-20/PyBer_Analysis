The image above depicts approximately how much money the rideshare program PyBer made bewteen the months of Janurary through the very end of April.  Through the figure,  it is evident the most profitable city type for the rideshare program are urban areas. This may be due to the higher population of people and the lack of personal vehicles present due to the pressence of mass transit in most urban areas. The least profitable city type for PyBer eill br thr rural areas. This may be due to the lower populations due to the farmlands, and there is a higher person to personal vehicle ratio present which dwindles the need for a rideshare program in the area.

In the chart above, it further breaks down exactly how much money is being invested into these areas via PyBer. As you can see, rural areas are being charged the highest fares per ride at $55.49, whereas, urban areas are being charged a measly $16.57 per ride. The difference in wages definitely a driving factor as to whether or not an indivual in a rural area would accept a ride. Suburban areas seem to float consistently in the middle of both urban and rural areas price points at an aproximate $39.50 per ride. Urban areas also have an abundance of drivers available, about 2,400 drivers available, compared to the average rural area only having about 78. This may be another driving factor of the high uber costs in rural areas. 


## Summary/Business Recommendations for CEO

*It may be more beneficial to study the entire year for the different trends. As the seasons may have different outcomes on people needing the assistance of a rideshare program.

*Consider expelling more drivers to rural areas in an effort to subset the higher than average costs of rides of consumers in that area.

*It may be beneficial to pay drivers with a base salary per ride and had on aditional fees based on things like duration, time of day, tolls, etc.
